# CyberVault Backend

CyberVault is a decentralized, AI-driven micro-finance platform designed for conflict zones impacted by cyber-financial warfare. This backend is built with Python FastAPI, focusing on security, offline-first functionality, and modularity for advanced features.

## Key Features
- **Secure Micro-Loans & Payments**: Robust APIs for micro-loan issuance, payments, and transaction management.
- **Offline-First**: Local SQLite storage and transaction queuing for internet disruptions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable transaction records via Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum testnet.
- **AI Fraud Detection**: Real-time and offline fraud detection using scikit-learn and TensorFlow models.
- **Advanced Security**: JWT, OAuth 2.0, AES-256 encryption, quantum-resistant cryptography, and zero-trust architecture.
- **Modular Design**: Ready for federated learning, ZKPs, homomorphic encryption, and decentralized identity.

## Directory Structure
- `main.py` — FastAPI entry point
- `models/` — Database and AI models
- `routes/` — API endpoints (auth, transactions, blockchain, AI)
- `services/` — Business logic, blockchain, AI, security
- `db/` — SQLite database and migration scripts
- `tests/` — Unit and integration tests

## Roadmap
1. Scaffold FastAPI backend with secure endpoints and offline queuing
2. Integrate blockchain and AI fraud detection modules
3. Implement advanced security (quantum-resistant crypto, ZKPs, federated learning)
4. Document API and deployment for portfolio demonstration
